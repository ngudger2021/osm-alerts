# OSM Alerts

A simple mobile-friendly web application for reporting road hazards using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.

Because the app relies on the browser's geolocation API, the page must be served via
HTTP/HTTPS (browsers block geolocation on plain `file://` URLs). Run a local server
and then open `http://localhost:8000/index.html`:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Once loaded, allow location access to see your position on the map. Use the `+`
button to report roadworks, potholes or crashes â€“ these markers are stored in your
browser's local storage.
